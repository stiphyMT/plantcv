def sobel_filter(img, dx, dy, k, device, debug=None):
    """This is a filtering method used to identify and highlight gradient edges/features using the 1st derivative.
       Typically used to identify gradients along the x-axis (dx = 1, dy = 0) and y-axis (dx = 0, dy = 1) independently.
       Performance is quite similar to Scharr filter. Used to detect edges / changes in pixel intensity. ddepth = -1
       specifies that the dimensions of output image will be the same as the input image.

    Inputs:
    # img    = image
    # dx     = derivative of x to analyze (1-3)
    # dy     = derivative of x to analyze (1-3)
    # k      = specifies the size of the kernel (must be an odd integer: 1,3,5...)
    # device = device number. Used to count steps in the pipeline
    # debug  = None, print, or plot. Print = save to file, Plot = print to screen.

    Returns:
    device   = device number
    sb_img   = Sobel filtered image
